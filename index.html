        <h1>The story of Lon</h1>
        <p>This is Lon’s workplace. An extraordinary artist and puppeteer, who created his own marionettes. Twelve, to be exact. He shaped them, gave them life, putting in blood, sweat, tears, lot’s of patience and a piece of his heart. In this space you can explore the true story of Lon. A story of resistance, consolation, liberty and love. </p>

          <p>It is over! Soldiers came to give back the freedom other soldiers took. No more abuse, no more humuliation. The trains that left from here to even darker places, will no longer depart.Now there is a chance. A chance to live again. But to forget what’s happened is impossible. Too much is lost, too many people are gone. And here in transit camp Dossin many questions still need answering.</p>

          <h1>Coat</h1>
          <p>Lon has a remarkable appearance; he has a big angular nose and he always wore a long camel coat. In the 1930s he works as a stage designer at the Royal National Theater and he dreams of a brilliant career as director.
          In 1943 his career ends abruptly, when he is arrested and captured in the Dossin Barracks in Malines.  However, the harsh reality does not crush his creativity and ambition. In order to survive the everyday suffering he asks the German officer for permission to build a marionette theater for the children in the camp...</p>

        <h1>Tijl</h1>
          <p>Meet Tijl. He is created by Lon, and one of the twelve puppets.</p>
          <p>Who is he?
          Well, Till Eulenspiegel is a folkloric character, used in the Second World War as a Flemish nationalist symbol against Nazism. Originally Till Eulenspiegel was a rascal in the sixteenth century, who fooled everybody in the former Netherlands (now Belgium and the Netherlands). He’s a trickster, a silly figure. In the 19th century, however, he was a resistance fighter who fought on the side of the Geuzen (Beggars) against the Spanish domination. He appeared in many stories to make people laugh.

        <h1>Worktools</h1>
          <p>Lon wants to bring some Belgium folklore to the people in the camp and decides to use his craftman’s skills and talent. He collects wood, paper, different kinds of fabric, pieces of leather and rope and starts creating.

          He cuts, scrapes wood, saws the fabric with excellent precision and patience. Sweat dripping on the floor, wounds on his fingers, taking all the time he needs to perfect the dolls he is shaping. With papier-maché heads, wooden limbs and joints held together by leather strips, dressed in beautiful funny costumes his puppets came to life. Like the stories he wants to share about life, fun and love. Outside this room he only finds stories about death.

          With thin strings on their arms and legs Lon he turns them into marionettes, to move them like real people. It takes him long and hard practise to learn how to play them. Time is not an obstacle. He has the patience. And, the longer it takes, the more change on survival.

        <h1>Fairytale forest</h1>
          <p>A story needs a stage. If anyone was aware of that, it was Lon. Before the war he was a stagedesigner so he set out to create a world for Tijl and his friends. A world of fairytales.  And to tell a proper fairytale you need a forest. A forest not only for Tijl and his friends to live in. It had to be a world Lon, his friend Irene, the camp children and their parents could escape to. A place where dragons, princesses and kings would come to life. A magical place, for in the real world the magic was long since lost. A place also of resistance. A place where good was still going to kick the hell out of evil.</p><p>And so Lon set out to create his forest. All over the camp he gathered feathers, fake pearls, paper, blankets and wood. After he spend weeks on it, he succeeded. Lon had created a new world.

        <h1>Love</h1>
          <p>There is a story to be found in almost every good drawing. Maybe that’s why Lon fell for Irene. With Irene, a Jewish artist from Germany, he shared a love for stories and art. She was one of the official painters in Dossin. Her job was to paint portraits of the German officers around.  Lon admired her for her talent, but also for something else: her enormous boobs. One day he told her: Your breasts will easily feed 5 children. She laughed about it and they became good friends.

          But Lon wanted more. He fell in love with Irene. But this love, like so many other things  in his life, wasn’t meant to be. She fell in love with another man. But the friendship between Lon and Irene remained.

        <h1>Deportation</h1>
          <p>After 14 months Lon's work was done: the magic forest was ready and the 12 marionettes looked eager to perform their first play.

          Lon's play never takes place...  In the 14 months of his captivity he saw many of the people in camp leaving on transports to so-called work camps.

          In the spring of 1944, Lon suffers the same fate. The German accuse him of communist leanings and on April 4th Lon says goodbye to Irene and his marionettes and boards a train ... to Auschwitz.

          Lon never returns.

        <h1>Twelve puppets</h1>
          <p>It feels weird. Outside this room there is chaos. Liberation has turned everything upside down. But here inside it is quiet.  Lon has been gone for months. And Tijl is the only puppet left. He didn’t use to be alone. He was surrounded by dragons, princesses,  Lamme goedzak, Irene the doll, many others and a wise King that ruled them all.

          But they have all been taken. By whom is hard to tell. Could it be one of the children? One of their parents? Many people felt close to the puppets. Or could it be someone else? Maybe it was Horsehead, a Flemish SS camp officer. That wouldn’t suprise Irene. Horsehead loved the marionettes.

          Irene had seen Horsehead visite the workplace, many times. He would linger there in his desire to touch Till and his twelve friends.  After his visit he would return to his other hobby: abusing and humilating prisoners.

          The truth still has to be found. 71 years after the libeartion there’s no sign Horsehead ever excisted. Many survivers of the camp are dead.

          Maybe you can help us solve the mystery.
